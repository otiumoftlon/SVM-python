This project entails the development of a Support Vector Machine (SVM) from scratch, incorporating kernel methods in Python. For flexibility, we will utilize the CVXPY library for optimization. The performance of our implementation will be compared against the well-established Scikit-learn library using the blobs dataset to evaluate their effectiveness.
